# Frame Cinema

<img src="public/readme-header.jpg" align="center"/>

## Overview

Web development project in which the idea was to create an app that displays data from any searched film. The fully responsive website has a theme switch button, category filters and a search bar.

In this project I used the free TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

Still in the development process...
